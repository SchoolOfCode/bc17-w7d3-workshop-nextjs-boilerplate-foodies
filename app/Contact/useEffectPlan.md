Phase 1: Preparation and Understanding
Understand useReducer:
Ensure all team members understand how useReducer works, focusing on state management in React.
Review examples and conduct a brief walkthrough of the syntax and use cases.
Backup the Current Component:
Make a copy of the existing form component as a backup.

Name the backup component as FormBackup.js or something similar.
Simplify the Form:
Remove all fields from the form except for one, e.g., "full name".
This simplified form should still function with the single field. Ensure the field updates state correctly.

Now check it works: Ensure the form works as expected with the single field using useState.

Phase 1 done ^

Phase 2: Transition to useReducer
Define Initial State:
Identify all current state variables managed by useState.
Mock up an initial state object combining these variables.
javascript

const initialState = {
    data: {
        fullName: '',
        // Add other fields as you progress
    },
    errorStatus: false,
    loading: false,
};
Create the Reducer Function:
Set up the reducer function to handle different actions.
Start with the CHANGE_FORM_DATA action to handle field updates.
javascript
function reducer(state, action) {
    switch (action.type) {
        case "CHANGE_FORM_DATA":
            return {
                ...state,
                data: {
                    ...state.data,
                    [action.payload.name]: action.payload.value,
                },
            };
        default:
            return state;
    }
}
Integrate useReducer into the Form Component:
Replace useState with useReducer in the form component.
Ensure the form updates the state via dispatch rather than setState.
javascript
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
Now check it works: Ensure the single field form works as expected with useReducer.
Expand to All Fields:
Gradually add back the other form fields (e.g., email, phone number) into the initial state and update the reducer to handle changes for these fields.
Now check it works: Confirm the form functions as before with all fields managed by useReducer.
Phase 3: Add New Functionality
Loading State Management:
Add a loading property to the initial state and create actions for form submission (SUBMIT_STARTED and SUBMIT_SUCCESS).
javascript

case "SUBMIT_STARTED":
    return {
        ...state,
        loading: true,
    };
case "SUBMIT_SUCCESS":
    return {
        ...state,
        loading: false,
        successMessage: "Form submitted successfully!",
    };
Implement a timeout to simulate the form submission process.
Now check it works: Ensure the form shows a loading state during submission.
Error State Management:
Implement the SUBMIT_FAILED action to handle validation errors.
Show specific error messages under each field when validation fails.
javascript
case "SUBMIT_FAILED":
    return {
        ...state,
        loading: false,
        errors: action.payload.errors,
    };
Now check it works: Validate the form and ensure specific error messages are displayed as per the validation rules.
Validation Enhancements:
Integrate the postcode validation using the Postcodes.io API.
Implement the API check during form submission to ensure bookings are only for England, Wales, or Scotland.
javascript
async function validatePostcode(postcode) {
    const response = await fetch(`https://api.postcodes.io/postcodes/${postcode}`);
    const data = await response.json();
    return ["England", "Wales", "Scotland"].includes(data.result.country);
}
Now check it works: Verify that the form correctly handles invalid postcodes by showing relevant error messages.
Final Touches:
Ensure the form cannot be submitted multiple times while in the loading state.
Add a success message after successful form submission (design this if necessary).
Review and test the form thoroughly to ensure all features work as expected.
Now check it works: Perform a full test to ensure the form meets all objectives.
Final Review and Testing
Conduct a full review of the form, testing each feature in various scenarios (e.g., valid/invalid input, edge cases).
Document any issues and resolve them before deployment.
Ensure the user experience is smooth, with clear feedback for all actions (loading, success, error states).
